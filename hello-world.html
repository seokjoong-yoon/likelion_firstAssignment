		<h2><strong>Self Introduction</strong></h2>
		<p>Hello, It's so honour to be accepted in LikeLion. Thank you.
		My name is Seokjoong-Yoon, and I'm in second grade of Sogang University, Department of English.
		I have grand field of interest, which includes literature, drawing, photography and computer engineering.. etc.
		In the middle of the computer engineering class, I was so strongly attracted by coding and so found what should I do
		to improve my skill further. Then there appeared LikeLion which looked so interesting, and then I decided to apply
		for it. I'm really enjoying happy coding at LikeLion recently.</p>
		<h2><strong>IT service</strong></h2>
		<p>I have wished to connect hummanity and technology and hope to find way at likelion.
		So, I'm planning to build translation site for amatures (who mostly would be university students who has adequate but
		not perfect skill). If one needs quick and quite accurate translation, he would request to the site, and there would be
		amature translator who would be payed for their work by the requestor.</p>
